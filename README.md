# Client-classification1

Here we describe a project developed inside a call-center operation of a large bank in Brazil whose objective was to sell credit cards for the clients of the bank.
Therefore, the idea was to identify which clients were more easily acessible through the phone and which ones were more prone to accept buying a credit card.

Note that in this context the objective is to minimize the sales effort focusing the sales effort into the right people (more easily reacheable through the phone and prone to
buy a credit card).
